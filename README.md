# Guess-the-Number Game in C

This number-guessing game uses only one single main.c file to run. A Makefile is also included, running "make" will run the gcc commands to compile main.

Inside the .vscode folder are various json files to make it possible to use VS Code's running/debugging capability. 

## Instructions

To play the game in your terminal, change directories to the top level where main.c is located.

Run `make` to build an executible called "guess". This will require a C compiler.

Run `./guess` in your terminal to start the executable. 

Your goal is to type an integer number into the terminal and guess a number randomly chosen at the start.

The program will say if your guess is high or low.

When the number is guessed, you will be conngratulated and the program will end.
